we have the following information from the garage:

•	Police cars are in use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
•	A workday for the garage (and mechanic) is 8 hours per day, 7 days a week.
•	Any cars scheduled to come in on a given day are left at the garage at the start of that day.
•	Scheduled maintenance jobs are interrupted for unscheduled police car arrivals.
•	Unscheduled police cars, however, cannot interrupt another unscheduled police car’s service.
•	Interrupted jobs will be serviced after all unscheduled jobs leave, for the remainder of their service time.
•	Unscheduled police cars arriving while the garage is closed wait until the garage is next open.

The garage has made available four datasets:

•	The number of scheduled cars that arrived for service each day (ArrivalScheduled.csv)
•	The time required to service scheduled vehicles (ServiceScheduled.csv)
•	The date and time that each unscheduled service police care arrived (ArrivalUnscheduled.csv)
•	The time required to service unscheduled vehicles (ServiceUnscheduled.csv)
